In submitting this work I acknowledge that I have read and understood the regulations and code regarding academic misconduct, including that relating to plagiarism, as specified in the Programme Handbook.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I wanted to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr.\ Tillman Weyde (with apologies for getting his first name wrong for months), to Dr.\ Chenxi Whitehouse, the original author of the preprint, and to Dr.\ Pranava Madhyastha for helping me take this great step in my academic career.
This was not an easy thesis to research and write, but the guidance and advice I received from each of the three collaborators helped me fully understand the context I was working on and in conducting meaningful research.

My most important takeaway from the thesis, which I learned thanks to the work from my collaborators, is my deeper understanding of how to conduct a rigorous academic project.
I plan to pursue a doctorate degree in the near future, and I am sure that the knowledge I gained in this project will make my future projects more thorough and efficient, and greatly improve my future academic work.

I also wanted to acknowledge the work done by the entire MSc in Artificial Intelligence in City~St.~Georges, University of London, for making a fantastic course.
I learned a lot in many subjects and areas, even in ones which I barely had an idea were so broad.
I also made a lot of contacts and good friends, who will definitely continue being a presence in my life after this MSc.
Most important of all, I had fun, and any doubts I had on returning to academia after many years in the industry were completely unfounded.

In particular, I wanted to acknowledge Dr.\ Esther Mondrag√≥n for being an outstanding professor and administrator, and for taking a very strong stance in ensuring that the standards for this Master's degree remain high.
My experience in this program was fantastic, and I hope the same continues being true for future students.
